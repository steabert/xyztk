xyztk: toolkit to transform XYZ coordinates of a molecule

The xyztk library is a toolkit developed for doing all kinds of
operations on xyz files.  All functions are implemented in the
xyztk-molecule.c file.  Currently some functions like translation,
rotation and scaling are available as simple stand-alone programs.
